# macOS Setup Instructions

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create the necessary files in:
- `dist/` - React frontend
- `dist-electron/` - Electron backend

### Step 3: Run the Application

**Option A: Development Mode (with hot-reload)**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Option B: Production Mode (using built files)**
```bash
npm run run-prod
```

**Option C: Use the stealth-run script**
```bash
chmod +x stealth-run.sh
./stealth-run.sh
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Window is Invisible by Default!

The application launches in invisible mode. To see the window:

**Press: `Cmd + B`** (or `Ctrl + B`)

You can use this shortcut repeatedly to show/hide the window.

### Application Icon in Dock

The application **now appears in the Dock** (bottom bar) so you can:
- Right-click the icon ‚Üí Quit
- Click and drag to Trash (while running)

1. Check if window is off-screen:
   - Try using `Cmd + ‚Üí` or `Cmd + ‚Üê` to move the window
   - The window might be positioned outside your screen bounds

3. Check Dock:
   - Look for the "Interview Coder" icon in the Dock
   - Right-click it to Quit if window is not responding

4. Force restart:
   ```bash
   # Kill any running instances
   pkill -f "Interview Coder"
   pkill -f "electron.*main.js"
   
   # Then run again
   npm run run-prod
   ```

## Step 4: Configure API Key

After opening the window (Cmd+B):

1. **If first time:**
   - You'll see a welcome screen with "Open Settings" button
   - Click "Open Settings"
   
2. **If already running:**
   - Click the **Settings** icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right corner
   
3. **In Settings window:**
   - Select **API Provider** (OpenAI, Gemini, or Anthropic)
   - Enter your **API Key** in the password field
   - Optionally select models for Extraction, Solution, and Debugging
   - Click **"Save Settings"**
   - The app will automatically reload

2. Drag "Interview Coder" to Applications folder
